* A method that returns the sum of two integers.

  -Casual Pseudo-code:
    Given 2 integers
    Assign their sum into a new variable and return the variable 
  -Formal Pseudo-code:
    START
    # Given integers num1 and num2
    SET sum = num1 + num2
    RETURN sum  
    END

* A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

  -Casual Pseudo-code:
    Given 1 array of strings
    Assign the sum of its elements into a new variable and return the variable
  -Formal Pseudo-code:
    START
    # Given 1 array arr
    SET concatenated_elements = method inject with ':+' on arr
    RETURN concatenated_elements
    END

* A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.

  -Casual Pseudo-code:
    Given 1 array 
    Initialize empty array called other_elements
    Iterate through the array 
      If the iteration counter is not odd, push respective array element into other_elements
    Return other_elements
  -Formal Pseudo-code:
    START
    # Given a collection of integers called 'integers'
    SET other_elements = 0
    FROM 0 UP TO integers size - 1
      IF iterator is not odd
        PUSH element of integers from current iteration into other_elements 
    RETURN other_elements
    END

* A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

  -Casual Pseudo-code: 
    Given 1 string and a given character
    Initialize counter to zero
    Initialize answer to nil
    Iterate through characters of string
      Compare current character to given character
        If they match, increase counter by 1
      Check if counter is 3
        If so, store current iterator in answer and break iteration
    Return answer 
  -Formal Pseudo-code:
    START 
    # Given string 'str' and character 'char'
    SET count = zero
    SET answer = nil
    SET iterator = zero
    FOR value IN str.SPLIT('') 
      SET count += 1 IF value = char 
      SET iterator += 1
      IF count = 3
        SET answer = iterator
        BREAK
    RETURN answer
    END

* A method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.

  -Casual Pseudo-code:
    Given 2 arrays, 1 & 2
    Initialize empty array called merged_arrays
    Iterate from 0 to array 1 length - 1
      Push iteration element from array 1 into merged_arrays
      Push iteration element from array 2 into merged_arrays
    Return merged_arrays
  -Formal Pseudo-code:
    START 
    # Given array_1 and array_2
    SET merged_arrays = []
    FROM 0 UP TO array_1.length - 1
      PUSH array_1 element at current iteration into merged_arrays
      PUSH array_2 element at current iteration into merged_arrays
    RETURN merged_arrays
    END
